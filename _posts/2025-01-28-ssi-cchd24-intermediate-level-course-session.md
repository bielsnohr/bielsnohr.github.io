In November 2024, I attended [CarpentryConnect](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html) in Heidelberg.
Along with Aleksandra Nenadic, I co-lead the Breakout Discussion "Developing and Delivering Training Material at the Intermediate Level".
The outcome of that session was [a blog post on the SSI blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/designing-effective-intermediate-level-courses-challenges-and-insights),
giving providing some initial guidance and advice about developing training material at the intermediate level.
We hope this will be starting point that many in the Carpentries teaching community will contribute to
and perhaps eventually make its way into formal lessons.
