Back in January, I had my first experience moderating a panel discussion. It
was one of the weekly [SORSE](https://sorse.github.io/) sessions, which overall
have provided the RSE community with an opportunity to present and network in
the absence of any in-person conferences. Fittingly, the subject of the panel
discussion was on the modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and how RSEs
have contributedâ€”and still are! It was a fascinating discussion, and you can
see the full recording of the event below:
