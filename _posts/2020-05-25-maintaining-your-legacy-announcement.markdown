title:  "SSI Collaboration Workshop 2020: Speed Blog Posted"
tags: ssi cw20 speed-blog

This is a quick announcement that my group's speed blog from the SSI
Collaborations Workshop 2020 has now been posted on the SSI blog: <https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-05-25-cw20-speed-blog-maintaining-your-legacy-tips-making-legacy-code-sustainable>

As the title suggests, it is all about legacy software and tips for how to
maintain it. My personal experience is with old Fortran 77 and 90 code, and
that is what I based my contribution to the article on. For me, I still get
caught up in the flawed physicist perspective that if code works, then
not much else matters.

Also, the process of writing the blog was a great learning experience and
spurned me to get going with my own blog writing.
