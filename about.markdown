Welcome, I'm Matt! Most of my adult life I have been a physicist. My PhD work
focussed on performing fundamental atomic physics calculations and modelling
for the spectroscopy of fusion plasmas.

Through this rewarding but challenging experience, I made an important
discovery about myself: the aspect I enjoyed most about my work was the
crafting of computer programs to solve problems rather than the nature of the
problems themselves.

As a result, I have made the career transitions to become a Research Software
Engineer. Now, I help physicists at the UK Atomic Energy Authority develop
their software.

If you need a more formal bio for a presentation or guest post, please see below.

## Official Bio

Matthew is a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the UK Atomic Energy Authority
(UKAEA), a world-leading laboratory in fusion energy research. There he supports
the development of research software primarily used for simulation and modelling
of fusion plasmas and tokamaks. He is a Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)
Fellow 2021, and his fellowship work has primarily focussed on delivering new
training courses at the intermediate level of software development skills. His
background is in physics having obtained a PhD in Atomic and Plasma Physics from
the University of Strathclyde with external work at the Culham Centre for Fusion
Energy.
