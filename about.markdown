Welcome, I'm Matt! Most of my adult life I have been a physicist. My PhD work
focussed on performing fundamental atomic physics calculations and modelling
for the spectroscopy of fusion plasmas. 

Through this rewarding but challenging experience, I made an important
discovery about myself: the aspect I enjoyed most about my work was the
crafting of computer programs to solve problems rather than the nature of the
problems themselves.

As a result, I have made the career transitions to become a Research Software
Engineer. Now, I help physicists at the UK Atomic Energy Authority develop
their software.
